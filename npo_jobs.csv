COMPANY PROFILE
At Springwell, we are serious about our mission. For more than 40 years, our staff has worked to help ensure that seniors and individuals with disabilities have the village they need and the support that is necessary for them to live at home with dignity and independence.
We are also serious about our employees. We are focused on creating a supportive, open environment that values the people who make a difference - each, and every member of our staff. 
We believe in: 

Accountability: At every level of the organization we are accountable: to the people we serve, to our funders, to our employees, to community professionals who rely on our support.
Continuous Quality Improvement: We honor the fact that each of us is human, and we embrace a desire to examine the value and quality of our work and ask how we can provide a higher quality of service.
Transparency: While we don't claim to be 100% transparent (there are certain things, like salaries and performance evaluations that are private) we continuously strive to be as open as possible.
Balance: Life is a give and take, as is work. We are always examining that balance. Today, we have yoga classes on-site twice a week. We are exploring offering a Weight Watchers meeting. And afternoon meditation is under consideration. If there is a holiday to celebrate we have a party. This year, we built a dedicated lactation room for new moms. We are committed to listening to our staff, and examining and re-balancing our work environment.

The Johnson O’Connor Research Foundation is dedicated to helping people of all ages (from high school to retirement) learn about their natural talents to discover work that is both satisfying and a natural fit. An aptitude consultant administers hands-on, timed tests and explains the results to clients to help with educational and career decisions.

The starting salary is $54,000.  We offer paid vacation, sick days, and generous full benefits (health/dental/vision insurance and a 403b retirement plan).  We are in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood. 

Our national organization is committed to the well-being of its employees.  We support staff enjoying life outside of work.  Our hours are Monday through Friday, 8:45 am to 5:00 pm, and there is no last minute or evening/weekend work required.   All test administration must be done in person using our physical test instruments, so we are unable to offer remote work options during the training period for test administrators; subsequently, one or two days a week can be remote. Most of our clients hear about us through word-of-mouth referral and no direct sales is required.

As this is a client-facing role, proof of Covid vaccination (or valid medical or religious exemption) is required.

Who we’re looking for:

You have at minimum a bachelor’s degree. No specific major is required, but psychology, career and educational counseling, sociology, and higher education administration are a plus, as is a year or more of professional work experience.  

You are intellectually curious and enjoy learning about people and the world of work.

You enjoy communicating with a wide range of people in a patient and encouraging manner.

You are comfortable moving quickly through testing, scoring, paperwork and counseling within set timeframes.  You can take in, synthesize, and interpret information quickly.

You are conscientious, showing care for both your team members (punctual, reliable, eager to help wherever needed) and for quality of services provided (minimizing mistakes, following research protocols. presenting test results positively).

You are comfortable with a small, close-knit work environment (you would be working with the current director and one other aptitude consultant), but you will be meeting new clients nearly every day.

You are interested in staying long enough in the position to fully implement your knowledge and skills (prefer 1 year or longer).

You are motivated to take on management responsibilities. Directorship of the office is an eventual possibility for the right candidate.

Daily Responsibilities:

•	Administer aptitude tests using a standardized script and hands-on props, many of which are timed.
•	Score tests and enter information into a database quickly and accurately. Answer phone calls and emails with questions from potential clients and schedule appointments.
•	Regularly meet with clients and their family members to explain their test results.  Many clients find this knowledge to be life-changing for them!

This is primarily a testing and advising role and not a research role. Our research department hires separately for research positions. We offer full training on administration of our own proprietary battery of aptitude tests, and on interpretation of the results. You can find more information about the Foundation and aptitude testing on our website: www.jocrf.org.

If this job sounds like something you’d love to do every day, we definitely want to hear from you!

Please, NO phone calls.  Interested applicants should send a cover letter (required) and resume via this link: https://jocrf.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=50&source=aWQ9OA%3D%3D 

Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation, Inc. is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer dedicated to a policy of non-discrimination in employment upon any basis, including but not limited to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or veteran status.

Fresh Connect Product Manager

About Fresh is a Boston-based nonprofit committed to expanding access to the high-quality, fresh food that is vital to people’s health, wellbeing, and culture. By empowering individual purchasing power, ensuring local and convenient access to fresh food, and taking into account the different ways in which people experience food, About Fresh is transforming the food system and who pays for it. About Fresh operates two programs:

Fresh Truck mobile markets bring affordable, healthy food to Boston neighborhoods;

Fresh Connect is a pre-paid debit card and analytic platform that enables healthcare providers to cover the cost of healthy food for patients and measure related health impacts.


Position Overview:

We are looking for an entrepreneurial Product Manager to lead product development, timelines, and deliverables for our Fresh Connect platform. This platform serves as our end-to-end program administration and cardholder support tool, analytic engine, and payment infrastructure, which is used to empower people with the money and flexibility to buy the foods they need to be healthy.

Working at the intersection of food access, healthcare technology, and payments innovation, you will be responsible for delivering and executing on the Fresh Connect product roadmap, which centers experiences of Fresh Connect cardholders, healthcare providers, and local and national grocers. 

The ideal candidate will be a people-centered leader with a proven capacity of building effective and mission-driven products. This role will report to the Fresh Connect Program Director and work cross-functionally with in-house and off site engineering teams.


What you’ll do: 

Collaborate with the Fresh Connect Program Director to identify and implement platform priorities and then take features from concept to reality

Gather and prioritize product and user requirements, collaborate with the Fresh Connect program team to define the product vision and work closely with engineering to deliver impactful solutions

Host product demos, feedback sessions, and partner focus groups to strengthen platform and feature development

Create, revise, and manage PRDs and pitches in close collaboration with the Fresh Connect Program Director 

Own the Fresh Connect product roadmap, developing growth focused timelines for feature development and setting up the team to hit deadlines

Effectively manage and clearly communicate expectations across multiple teams and stakeholders

Be an active learner in the emerging space of healthy food incentive technology


Who you are:

A leader. You are able to rally a team together around an impactful vision. You know how to work autonomously, when to bring others in to collaborate, and how to ask for help.

A bias towards action. We’re a small organization with a big vision, so we empower our team to make decisions and act quickly. You can execute autonomously on well-defined features and initiatives.

Make complex topics simple to digest. You are able to work with world class clinicians, patient care managers, grocery retailers, and every day people experiencing hardship to understand their needs and deliver solutions that make a meaningful impact on their lives.

High degree of cultural and social competency. You embrace working across a diverse network of teammates, partners, and user communities. You build effective products by leading with curiosity, empathy, and honoring people as experts in their own lives. 

Remote management experience. You feel confident working with a remote team and can communicate, build and ship products while working with stakeholders across multiple time zones.

Background in engineering is a plus. Although this is not a technical role, having technical experience is helpful. Specifically working in healthcare or payments technology is a huge plus.

A natural learner. You embrace the unknown and iteration. Constant learning, prototyping, A/B testing, and analysis are critical and you facilitate these processes effectively.


What you’ll get:

Work with a dynamic, dedicated, and diverse team to make it easier for people to get the food they need to be healthy, happy, and hopeful

Competitive benefits package provided for employees and eligible dependents, including full employer paid health, subsidized dental and vision coverage

3 weeks paid vacation time, plus paid company holidays

403-b retirement savings matching

Personal learning and development funds

The salary range for this position is $90,000 - $100,000
